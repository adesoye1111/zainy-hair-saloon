	<h2 id="h2">HAIRSTYLES & HAIRCUTS FOR WOMEN</h2>
	<hr>
	<h2>Short Wavy Bob</h2>
	<p>The bob is one of the most significant hairstyle trends of late. It is the perfect combination of edgy yet pretty with just the right amount of masculinity to make it on-trend. If you’re tired of the classic bob, try mixing things up with this wavy style. Bobs and waves are a match made in hair heaven. Nothing says cool-girl chic like a touselled just rolled out of bed crop. However, if you’re still looking to turn things up, try rocking this blunt cut front fringe. It is edgy and unique without being too out there. And did we mention that it is also a super-flattering style?</p>

	<h2>Blunt Cut</h2>
	<p>If you suffer from thin hair syndrome, you’ll know the struggle of wanting a cute pixie cut and leaving the salon looking like a baby-haired Draco Malfoy. Well, those dreaded days are over. A blunt cut is perfect for women with thin hair who still want to rock a shorter style. Not only are blunt cuts a great way to frame your face and accentuate your features, but they are also universally flattering, and very on-trend. If you haven’t noticed, the masculine trend is on the rise, and a blunt cut in short hair is the perfect way to dive headfirst into the manly mania. If you want to keep a femme element, try adding a few waves throughout your hair, or rock a pair of extravagant earrings or a feminine, flowy dress.</p>

	<h2>Low Bun</h2>
	<p>Even with the chicest cut, there will still be some days when you can’t resist the messy bun. It is the bad boy of hairstyles, we know we shouldn’t do it, but its allure is just too strong. With short hair, you may find yourself struggling to achieve the messy high bun. If so, go for the low option.  This may not be something you have thought of, but a low messy bun achieves the same level of simple styling as a high topknot while making your locks appear thicker too. Just gather your hair at the nape of your neck and twist it into a bun the same way you would if the hair was on top of your head. If you have bangs, allow them to fall freely across your face, or pull a few strands out around your face and behind your ears to create a soft, elegant style.</p>

	<h2>Short and Straight</h2>
	<p>Who says you need long locks to rock the iconic Rachel Green look? Short, straight hair with a mid-part is one of the all-time greats. And it’s not going anywhere, anytime soon. Mix up the classic 90s style with a blunt bob and a platinum blonde. This cut is striking, flattering, and just screams attitude. Channel your inner punk rock princess with a deep purple or red lipstick and heavy eye makeup.</p>

	<h2>Pixie Cut</h2>
	<p>Going short can be very daunting for women with thick hair. When it goes wrong, it goes very very wrong (we’ve all had those awkward bowl looking haircuts). But the key to nailing short styles with thick hair is layers and texture. Avoid blunt cuts as this style will add bulk to your hair. Instead go for a layered, textured pixie cut. The layers will take some the weight out of your luscious locks allowing them to sit and flow with ease.</p>

	<h2>Twists</h2>
	<p> few sexy twists are a great way to breathe some life into your cropped hairstyle. Not only is this a unique look, but it will also protect your locks too. The twists require zero additional styling and will let your hair repair itself from damage sustained from heat, coloring and just the general wears and tears of life.</p>

	<h2>Bangs</h2>
	<p>Bangs are back, and short hair is here to stay, so why not combine two of the biggest hair trends from recent years? Simple and easy to style, bangs also require very little maintenance, other than the occasional trim. Bangs in short hair work particularly well as the frame your face, drawing attention to your features. This can also be a slimming style if you find your short hair is making you look a little fuller in the face. From side to front, choppy to blunt, curtain or sweeping, there are endless styling opportunities when it comes to bangs.</p>

	<h2>Short Thin Hair</h2>
	<p>From bobs to faux hawks, pixie cuts, undercuts, asymmetric styles, and everything in between, short cuts were made for thin hair.  That’s when they’re styled right of course. A short cut is one of the best ways to not only create the illusion of thickness but also, to allow your hair to thicken up naturally. With regular trims and less styling, your hair will become healthier. Therefore, it will begin to grow much faster and thicken up on its own over time.</p>

	<h2>Short Thick Hair</h2>
	<p>You may be hesitant to partake in the short hair trend if you are blessed with naturally thick hair. But, short styles look like magic in a thick mane. Making the chop can also be a great way to take some weight out of your locks for the summer months. Ladies with thick hair can rock anything from short pixie cuts to bobs, with choppy layers, front fridges or side sweeping bangs. The key to short, thick hair is texture. So make sure to add a few layers to keep your hair light and sitting nicely.</p>

	<h2>Short Curly Hair</h2>
	<p>If you find your long curls are weighing you down then why not make the chop? Not only will a short style make your curls more manageable, but this flirty hairstyle is ideal for summer. From pin-curled pixie cuts and bouncy bobs, the styling opportunities for short curly hair are truly versatile.</p>

		<legend id="legend"><h2>What is the hairstyle for 2020?</h2></legend>
		<p><strong>The trendiest hairstyles for 2020 are throwing it back to the 70s for inspiration. The modern shag and curtain bangs are two of the most popular hairstyles for women. The shag is an edgy take on layers providing lots of texture and movement. Meanwhile, curtain bangs are a great way to keep the length, yet still frame the face with a fringe.</strong></p>

		<legend id="legend"><h2>What is the easiest haircut to maintain?</h2></legend>
		<p><strong>The easiest haircut to maintain for women is the bob and lob haircuts. They have a decent amount of length that makes them versatile, without the effort of super long hair. You can wash, dry, and style fairly efficiently at this length as well. Plus, these styles only need semi-regular cuts to keep the shape, so you don't have to visit the salon every six weeks.
